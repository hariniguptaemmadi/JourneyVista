# JourneyVista

JourneyVista is an interactive tourism platform powered by Gemini AI, designed to offer curated travel experiences across Indian states. From real-time weather updates to a smart AI chatbot, JourneyVista is your one-stop portal for discovering the rich culture, heritage, cuisine, and destinations of India.

## Features

-**Search-Driven Navigation**: Search for any of the top 5 tourism states (Rajasthan, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Goa) and get redirected to detailed state pages. Other queries redirect to Google search.
-**Gemini AI Chatbot**: Engage with an intelligent chatbot that answers questions about Indian tourism, major states, famous places, culture, food, and travel tips.
-**Live Weather Info**: View real-time weather updates for five major tourism states.
-**Custom UI Navigation**: Access 'About', 'Customise', and chatbot sections through an intuitive interface.
-**State-Specific Pages**: Dive into detailed tourism data, attractions, and facts for the top Indian tourism destinations.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (with Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend/API**: Gemini AI API for chatbot responses
- **Weather Integration**: OpenWeatherMap API (or any suitable weather API)
- **Routing**: React Router / Custom JS routing logic

##How It Works

The chatbot handles user queries using the Gemini API, specifically trained on Indian tourism data.
The search bar and chatbot both parse queries — if a query matches one of the top 5 tourism states, it navigates to the relevant page; otherwise, it redirects to Google.
The weather section fetches live data using a weather API and displays it in a clean UI.
The About and Customise sections give users insight into the platform and allow AI-powered trip planning.
